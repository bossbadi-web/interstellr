    At Interstellr, we consider your safety to be of utmost importance. While we don't expect you to become experienced
    astronauts before taking the trip, we do require that you are familiar with basic skills in face of an emergency.
    The goal of each class in the training regimen is to prepare you for your tour and uplift your confidence so you can
    enjoy the journey of a lifetime.
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>
      Training involves both hands-on and in-class learning. The training regimen is built to take 3 to 10 days to
      complete, depending on your tour. Our training classes are taught by dedicated, trained, and certified staff with
      at least 3 years of flight experience. You must take part in all the prerequisite classes in order to fly, along
      with being cleared medically for the flight. Consult the chart below for specifics and to learn what classes you
      will need to take.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interstellr training centers are spread out over all major cities in the US, along with some international
      locations as well. You will choose your personal training schedule and center after registration. For those who
      would like them, additional training resources, such as retaking a class, are available free of charge, based on
      Interstellr instructor availability and tour dates. If you have any questions, please contact us immediately.
    </p>

    <h2>Specifics</h2>
    <p>
      Astronauts practice in life-sized models, called Space Vehicle Mock-up Facility. This way, they can learn how to
      move about in the facility.
    </p>
    <p>There are many different ways to train for microgravity:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        There is a plane called KC-135, which is one way they experience microgravity. They fly the plane all the way
        into the air and quickly nosedive, providing a microgravity environment.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is a "Precision Air-Bearing Floor," which allows astronauts to experience moving heavy objects as if they
        are in space, where there is no friction present.
      </li>
      <li>
        To practice leaving the space shuttle to make repairs to the ship, astronauts go underwater. Since waterâ€™s
        gravitational level is lower than normal, it is a perfect place to practice. Furthermore, astronauts could
        practice in the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory Pool, where they can insert panels simulating the outside of space.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      People need to be physically fit to be an astronaut. In space, it may be hard to stay fit. Fortunately, there are
      specialized treadmills in the space station.

              While Interstellr has not as of yet had even a single life-threatening situation develop on its tours,
              emergencies can happen at any time, and it's crucial to have the skills and knowledge to know what to do
              then. While onboard a tour, you can have two kinds of emergencies: medical, wherein the pilot or a fellow
              passenger is affected, or orbital, which includes failure of mechanical systems on the vehicle you're
              using.
            </p>
            <p class="mx-3 text-center">
              For onboard emergencies, such as failure of navigation or life support systems or a loss of pressure,
              you'll learn how to turn on backup systems, communicate with ground control, and otherwise be prepared for
              such an eventuality. For medical emergencies, you'll learn how to assess and treat a range of common
              injuries and illnesses, from cuts and burns to fractures and sprains. You'll also learn how to recognize
              the signs of more serious medical conditions, such as heart attacks and strokes, and how to respond
              effectively to these emergencies.
            </p>
            <p class="mx-3 text-center">
              Our experienced instructors will guide you through hands-on training exercises, allowing you to practice
              and refine your skills in a safe and supportive environment. By the end of the class, you'll have the
              knowledge and confidence to handle a variety of medical and orbital emergency situations, making you a
              valuable asset.
