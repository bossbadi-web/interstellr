    <h2>Vehicle</h2>
    <p>
      The spaceship is a 292-foot-long vessel that is designed to take you on a 6-hour flight. It is equipped with two
      360 degrees rotating stern thrusters for precise mobility and dynamic positioning. The spaceship is designed to
      have a low G force and give you the feel of an astronaut and a view of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      It features a lot of glass for viewing and a shape designed for a smooth landing in the ocean or other bodies of
      water, which can accommodate eight passengers.
    </p>

    <h2>Safety</h2>
    <p>
      Test flights are beginning soon this year to verify that we are ready to go commercial. Communications throughout
      the operation – between land, sea, and capsule – will be provided by Silvus Technologies, utilizing military-grade
      StreamCaster MANET radios and MN-MIMO waveform technology. To provide comfort and decrease the chance of health
      issues on the flight, the vessel will be pressurized.
    </p>

    <h2>Launch</h2>
    <p>
      We do our best to create ideal launch conditions making flights as frequent as possible. We constantly plan to
      move to areas of good weather and follow the sea breeze to minimize the impact of wind and minimize the likelihood
      of complications.
    </p>

    <h2>Recovery</h2>
    <p>
      The cone shape at the bottom of the vessel will provide flyers with a smooth landing in the water. Fast boats from
      Fluid Watercraft will stabilize the capsule after it lands in the water so that the Marine Spaceport can lift it
      from the water and take it back to a launch site.

    <h1 style="text-align: center">The History of Spaceflight</h1>
    <p>
      Space exploration has been a part of human history for decades. In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the first
      artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, into orbit. This sparked a space race between the Soviet Union and the United
      States, leading to several significant achievements. In 1961, Yuri Gagarin became the first human to journey into
      space. The Zenith of the space race came in 1969, when the United States successfully landed astronauts on the
      moon during the Apollo 11 mission. Since then, space exploration has continued with the launch of space probes,
      orbiting telescopes, and space stations. Today, many countries and private companies are actively involved in
      space exploration, with the goal of exploring further into our solar system and beyond.
